# Auto Login Backoffice Prestashop Module

Create unique links to automatically login users in your shop's backoffice using this module. Ideal for demo shops.

As a module author, we always provide a demo account to login to the demo shop's backoffice so that users can check the functionality of a module. This module makes that process much simpler. 

Once installed, this module will allow you to create demo links which when clicked will automatically login to the backoffice. You can also set the user and shop (in case of multishop). 

This module allows you to create multiple demo links (for different demo accounts or demo shops (in case of multi shop)). 

# Configuration
Go to module's configuration page and select the shop (if multistore) and Employee account and click Save. You will see an URL generated for that store and employee account. Simply copy the URL and share it.
